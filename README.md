# Alien Invasion: A Python Space Shooter

A classic arcade-style space shooter game built with Python and the Pygame 
library. This project is based on the "Alien Invasion" project from the 
book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. The player controls a spaceship 
at the bottom of the screen and must shoot down waves of incoming aliens.
